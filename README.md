## Usage / Quick Start

1. **Open Kupo** ‚Äì The app opens with a clean interface.  
2. **Project Management** ‚Äì Use the sidebar on the left to **create a new project** or **select an existing project** to edit.  
3. **Edit Components** ‚Äì Once a project is selected, the main central area displays the **configurations for your website components**. You can modify content, styles, and layouts directly from here.  
4. **Build Your Site** ‚Äì After customizing your site:
   - **Select the project** you want to build in.  
   - Choose the **output folder** where the `index.html` and associated files will be generated.

5. **Export / Deploy** ‚Äì Once the build is complete, the folder contains a ready-to-use static website that can be deployed anywhere.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With  

- **Electron + Vite + React + TypeScript** ‚Äì the base stack for building Kupo.  
- **Electron Vite** ‚Äì super fast build tooling for Electron apps. Learn more at [electron-vite.org](https://electron-vite.org/).  
- **Vanilla CSS** ‚Äì no Tailwind (yet) because the setup gave me trouble, but everything still works fine.  

## üìñ Documentation / Tips (For Contributors & Developers)

### Frontend Overview
The frontend lives in the **`src/renderer`** folder. The entry point is `App.tsx`, which directs into the main **Dashboard** component.

#### Components Structure
- **Assets/** ‚Äì Contains a few static images used across the UI.  
- **Build/** ‚Äì Houses the build dialog logic and UI.  
  - `BuildDialog.tsx` ‚Äì Controls which build step/page is visible (swipe-style navigation).  
  - `pages/` ‚Äì Contains individual step pages of the build process.  
- **Dashboard/** ‚Äì Core of the app‚Äôs UI.  
  - `NavDashboard.tsx`, `SideDashboard.tsx`, `MainDashboard.tsx` ‚Äì Define the layout.  
  - `components/` ‚Äì Reusable elements like `CustomToolTip.tsx` and dialogs.  
  - `RenderSection.tsx` ‚Äì Critical: dynamically renders sections (Navbar, Hero, Feature, Footer).  
  - `StyleDialog.tsx` ‚Äì Handles user CSS edits, pushing changes back via `updateData({})` in `MainDashboard.tsx`.  
- **Loading/** ‚Äì Contains `LoadingOverlay.tsx` for showing loading states anywhere in the app.  
- **Styles/** ‚Äì Individual CSS files per component (keeps styles scoped and maintainable).  

#### Config & Interfaces
- **Interface/** ‚Äì Defines how data in config files is structured.  
  - **Default Sections/** ‚Äì Default objects for `Navbar`, `Hero`, `Feature`, and `Footer`.  
    - Split into multiple files when configs are large (e.g., `navbarLinkStyle.ts`, `navbarLogoStyle.ts`).  
  - **Presets/** ‚Äì Predefined style options (e.g., `style.ts`, `background.ts`, `fontFamily.ts`, `uiBlocks.ts`).  
  - **Types/** ‚Äì TypeScript interfaces for each major component (Navbar, Hero, Feature, Footer).  
  - *In short: `default sections` = actual default objects; `types` = the shape/interface of those objects.*  

#### IPC Bridge
- **Lib/** ‚Äì The IPC bridge.  
  - `ipc.ts` exposes Electron backend functions as simple frontend APIs (e.g. `window.electronAPI.sendData({ ... })` becomes just `sendData({ ... })`).  
  - Keeps frontend clean and abstracts away the verbose Electron API calls.  

#### Key Notes
- Configuration-driven: All changes (CSS + content) flow through the `updateData({})` function in `MainDashboard.tsx`.  
- Sections are modular and extendable ‚Äî new sections can be added by following the `RenderSection` pattern.  
- IPC bridge in `lib/ipc.ts` is the main way frontend communicates with the backend.
