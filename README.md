You can download the latest stable release of Kupo for your platform:

- **Windows:** Download the `.exe` installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/KunalSharma108/Kupo/releases) page.
- **Linux:** Download the `.AppImage` or `.deb` package from the same [Releases](https://github.com/KunalSharma108/Kupo/releases) page.

Simply run the installer (Windows) or follow your distro‚Äôs installation steps (Linux) to start using Kupo.

## Features

Kupo is designed to help non-technical users create static websites quickly and easily. Its core features include:

- **Four main components:** Navbar, Hero, Feature sections, and Footer ‚Äî enough to build a typical website.  
- **Config-driven customization:** Every aspect, from content to CSS, can be modified. Default configurations are provided for each component when added, so you can get started immediately.  
- **Flexible backgrounds:** Components can use solid colors, gradients, images, or a combination of image + gradient ‚Äî not just static colors.  
- **Font options:** Multiple fonts are provided to style your text the way you want.  
- **Exploration-friendly:** Many additional customization options are left for users to discover, giving full creative freedom.  

## Usage / Quick Start

1. **Open Kupo** ‚Äì The app opens with a clean interface.  
2. **Project Management** ‚Äì Use the sidebar on the left to **create a new project** or **select an existing project** to edit.  
3. **Edit Components** ‚Äì Once a project is selected, the main central area displays the **configurations for your website components**. You can modify content, styles, and layouts directly from here.  
4. **Build Your Site** ‚Äì After customizing your site:
   - **Select the project** you want to build in.  
   - Choose the **output folder** where the `index.html` and associated files will be generated.  
   - Kupo will **copy all images and assets** used in the project into the output folder and generate the static website.  
5. **Export / Deploy** ‚Äì Once the build is complete, the folder contains a ready-to-use static website that can be deployed anywhere.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With  

- **Electron + Vite + React + TypeScript** ‚Äì the base stack for building Kupo.  
- **Electron Vite** ‚Äì super fast build tooling for Electron apps. Learn more at [electron-vite.org](https://electron-vite.org/).  
- **Vanilla CSS** ‚Äì no Tailwind (yet) because the setup gave me trouble, but everything still works fine.  

## üìñ Documentation / Tips (For Contributors & Developers)

### Frontend Overview
The frontend lives in the **`src/renderer`** folder. The entry point is `App.tsx`, which directs into the main **Dashboard** component.

#### Components Structure
- **Assets/** ‚Äì Contains a few static images used across the UI.  
- **Build/** ‚Äì Houses the build dialog logic and UI.  
  - `BuildDialog.tsx` ‚Äì Controls which build step/page is visible (swipe-style navigation).  
  - `pages/` ‚Äì Contains individual step pages of the build process.  
- **Dashboard/** ‚Äì Core of the app‚Äôs UI.  
  - `NavDashboard.tsx`, `SideDashboard.tsx`, `MainDashboard.tsx` ‚Äì Define the layout.  
  - `components/` ‚Äì Reusable elements like `CustomToolTip.tsx` and dialogs.  
  - `RenderSection.tsx` ‚Äì Critical: dynamically renders sections (Navbar, Hero, Feature, Footer).  
  - `StyleDialog.tsx` ‚Äì Handles user CSS edits, pushing changes back via `updateData({})` in `MainDashboard.tsx`.  
- **Loading/** ‚Äì Contains `LoadingOverlay.tsx` for showing loading states anywhere in the app.  
- **Styles/** ‚Äì Individual CSS files per component (keeps styles scoped and maintainable).  

#### Config & Interfaces
- **Interface/** ‚Äì Defines how data in config files is structured.  
  - **Default Sections/** ‚Äì Default objects for `Navbar`, `Hero`, `Feature`, and `Footer`.  
    - Split into multiple files when configs are large (e.g., `navbarLinkStyle.ts`, `navbarLogoStyle.ts`).  
  - **Presets/** ‚Äì Predefined style options (e.g., `style.ts`, `background.ts`, `fontFamily.ts`, `uiBlocks.ts`).  
  - **Types/** ‚Äì TypeScript interfaces for each major component (Navbar, Hero, Feature, Footer).  
  - *In short: `default sections` = actual default objects; `types` = the shape/interface of those objects.*  

#### IPC Bridge
- **Lib/** ‚Äì The IPC bridge.  
  - `ipc.ts` exposes Electron backend functions as simple frontend APIs (e.g. `window.electronAPI.sendData({ ... })` becomes just `sendData({ ... })`).  
  - Keeps frontend clean and abstracts away the verbose Electron API calls.  

#### Key Notes
- Configuration-driven: All changes (CSS + content) flow through the `updateData({})` function in `MainDashboard.tsx`.  
- Sections are modular and extendable ‚Äî new sections can be added by following the `RenderSection` pattern.  
- IPC bridge in `lib/ipc.ts` is the main way frontend communicates with the backend.  

### Preload (bridge listeners)

The `preload` script exposes a thin API (`window.electronAPI.*`) to the renderer.  
It‚Äôs mostly the same as vanilla preload, but with extra `.on` listeners and convenience wrappers for common actions.  
Example: complex native calls are exposed as simple functions (e.g. `sendData(payload)`), so frontend code doesn't need to deal with low-level IPC details.

---

### Backend Overview

Backend code lives in `src/main` (or `main/` depending on your layout). The entry files:

- `index.ts` ‚Äî standard Electron bootstrap (creates BrowserWindow, basic config).  
- `main.ts` ‚Äî central IPC router: listens to preload/renderer events and delegates work to helper modules. `main.ts` keeps logic thin and calls functions defined elsewhere to keep concerns separated.

#### `functions/` folder
Two main files plus a `build/` folder:

- `project.ts`
  - CRUD for projects: `fetchProjects()`, `createProject()`, `renameProject()`, `deleteProject()`, etc.
  - Responsible for filesystem-level project management and project metadata.

- `config.ts`
  - Handles config data for a given project.
  - Exposes `fetchConfig(projectId)` and `updateConfig(projectId, data)` used by the UI.

#### `build/` folder (the build system)
This is where the static-site generation happens.

- `main.ts`
  - Entry point for the build process. Orchestrates building of all sections by calling component-specific builders.
  - Receives `data`, `win` (BrowserWindow) and `directory` (output dir) ‚Äî these are the three main props passed around.

- `sendLog.ts`
  - Small helper to send build logs back to the renderer (like a lightweight websocket).
  - Standard message shape: `{ message: string, type: 'normal'|'warning'|'error' }`.
  - Use this instead of calling `win.webContents.send()` everywhere.

- `lib/` (helpers used during build)
  - `preset/` ‚Äî presets used by the builder (e.g., color presets).
  - `style/` ‚Äî helper utilities to translate config styles into CSS-friendly values (used by build).
  - `template/`
    - `html.ts` ‚Äî returns final HTML string for `index.html`.
    - `props.ts` ‚Äî returns CSS props / values for templates.

- `components/` (actual component builders)
  - Each major section (navbar, hero, feature, footer) has its own folder and build functions.
  - **Important:** `getcss.ts` is the critical helper ‚Äî it accepts the `style` or `hoverStyle` object for a component and returns compiled CSS for that section.
  - File counts vary by component complexity (navbar more files, footer fewer).

#### Conventions / important notes
- The build pipeline mostly passes three things around:
  1. `data` ‚Äî the config object for the project/sections
  2. `win` ‚Äî the BrowserWindow (used for progress/log IPC)
  3. `directory` ‚Äî output root where `index.html`, images, fonts, and assets are placed
- Asset handling:
  - `lib/copyImage.ts` is used to copy images from user locations into the output directory.
  - Fonts, images and other assets are copied into the build output automatically during the build.
- Styles generation:
  - Styles are produced by modular functions in `build/lib/style/` (background, border, layout, shadow, transition, etc.) ‚Äî these produce strings that `getcss.ts` stitches into the final CSS.
- Keep `main.ts` thin ‚Äî it should delegate. If you add new features, add them under `functions/` or `build/components/` rather than stuffing logic into `main.ts`.

### Quick pointers for contributors
- If you want to add a new section:
  1. Add default config + types in `frontend/src/renderer/interface/*` (default sections, types, presets).
  2. Implement a renderer UI in `Dashboard/RenderSection` + `StyleDialog` pattern.
  3. Add a build implementation in `main/functions/build/components/<your-section>` that outputs HTML + CSS and uses `getcss.ts` pattern.
- To follow logs during a build, use `sendLog()` rather than emitting arbitrary events.
- Search for `updateData({})` (frontend) ‚Üí trace to `project/config` functions (backend) to see the full data flow.
